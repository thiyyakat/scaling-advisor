# Scaling Advisor Design

## High-Level Picture

![High Level Diagram](./assets/scaling-advisor-highlevel.svg)

- `ScalingAdvisor` is an *advisory-controller* that reconciles `ClusterScalingConstraint` and `ClusterScalingAdviceFeedback` and generates next `ClusterScalingAdvice`
- Real actions are taken by a consuming lifecycle management component like the MCM. Scaling advisor does not take actions



## Internals

### Simulation Engine 

![Node Pool Simulation](./assets/scaling-advisor-simulator.svg)

- The `ScalingAdvisor` leverages a minimal in-memory KAPI (called `minkapi`) to hold cluster snapshot (k8s objects such as existing nodes, pods, volumes, volume-attachments, etc.) of the real cluster.
- The base `minkapi` offers *in-memory* k8s client implementations for [kuberentes.Interface](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes#Interface) and [dynamic.Interface](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/dynamic#Interface) 
- `minkapi` also supports *sandboxed views* and in-memory clients for the sandboxed views which are consumable by the `kube-scheduler`. 
  - The sandbox clients *decorate* the base clients and maintain their own internal state. Changes made by a scheduler instance are limited to its own sandbox and are not propagated to the master data.
- The simulator creates a sandbox, chooses a NodePool and creates virtual Nodes corresponding to the NodePool inside the sandbox. It then runs an embedded scheduler instance that operates against the sandbox.
- The scheduler assigns pods to the virtual nodes inside the sandbox.
- Node scores are computed from the pod to the virtual node assignment wrt to configurable strategies. Ex: normalize price of assigned pod resources
- The node pool with the max score is chosen and cluster scaling advice is generated.
